# Reader requirements:
#   - Single pass reading.
#   - Read until one of the following is encountered:
#	'<', '#', "//", "/*", "<!--", '"', ''', '\'
#   - if a '\' is hit, ignore the next character (including newlines)
#   - if a component is hit ('<'):
#	- Create LayoutComponent
#	- recurse on children if they exist
#	- Continue populating LayoutComponent until /> or </component>
#   - if a single line comment is hit, skip the rest of the line
#   - if a multi line comment is hit, skip until end is found
#   - if a ''' or '"' is found (perhaps " should escape, ' should not?)
#	- convert rest of line to String (and possibly subsequent lines)
#	- if during component-search mode, create a StaticText (or
#	    verbatim) UIComponent
